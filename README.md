# DataHeterogeneity
The official code for "How Does Data Heterogeneity Affect the Convergence Rates of Distributed Linear System Solvers?"

This code performs the numerical calculations described in the aforementioned paper. It also contains an implementation of Algorithm I, with small changes (calculates the cosine of the angle rather than the angle itself for code brevity).
