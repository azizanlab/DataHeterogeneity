# DataHeterogeneity
The official code for "Distributed Linear Solvers and Data Heterogeneity" (arXiv link https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10640v3).

This code performs the numerical calculations described in the aforementioned paper. Namely, it contains a simple implementation of Algorithm 4.1 (the computation of cos(\theta_H)) and the numerical calculation of all the necessary components of Equation 7.1 (the CDF of \theta_{ij}) from the Experiments section.
